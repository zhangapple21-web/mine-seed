## Current Sprint

**P0: Environment Awareness — Closing the loop**

Status: **In Progress**

Goal: Make ACE autonomously discover problems, ask questions, research answers, and sediment experience — without waiting for user input.

---

## Today (2026-07-10)

### What was accomplished

1. **去TRAE化完成** — Local Miner v2, multi-source fallback (Ollama → GitHub → Zhipu → OpenRouter)
2. **Capability Graph** — 13 capabilities with inheritance, capability-first routing
3. **Provider Health Monitor** — Health-score-driven routing, skip down providers
4. **Environment Layer (ENV-001)** — Sensor + SituationBuilder, integrated into Heartbeat
5. **Awareness Loop P0 (ENV-002)** — Sensor→Question→Task→Miner→Experience closed loop
6. **Provider Failure Sediment** — Auto-write Experience when provider degrades (failure→experience→constraint)
7. **Dual Memory System** — AGENTS.md (long-term) + CURRENT_STATE.md (daily)

### Key Insight

> Development priority shifted: "adding abilities" → "making existing abilities collaborate"

This is the turning point of R2.
A mature system gets more restrained, not larger.
It doesn't keep gaining new abilities — it keeps improving collaboration efficiency.

## Known Problems

| Problem | Severity | Impact | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| OpenRouter key expired (401) | Medium | Fallback chain works, but one less provider | 🟡 Open |
| GitHub Models key expired (401) | Medium | Fallback chain works, but one less provider | 🟡 Open |
| akshare not installed | Low | Falls back to Tencent API, stock coverage limited | 🟡 Open |
| Provider Health not persisted across restarts | Medium | In-memory only, restart = reset | 🟡 Open |
| Heartbeat doesn't run Awareness Loop | High | Scans but never generates questions/tasks | 🔴 High |
| Awareness Loop rules too narrow | Medium | Only 6 categories, misses common observations | 🟡 Open |
| RoundTable not wired into Awareness Loop | Low | Experience written but not reviewed | 🟡 Open |
| Curator stopped (ace_core lagged mine-seed 8 days) | Medium | Runtime core repo not updated, distilled copy stale | 🟢 Fixed (manual sync 7/10) |
| r1-archaeology stale (1 day) | Low | R1 archaeology repo not getting R2 findings | 🟡 Open |
| r1-open-source-seed empty | Low | Public seed repo has only logs/ dir | 🟡 Open |
| R1 repo dormant | Low | Philosophy/website repo is just a README | 🟡 Open |
| coze-assets status unknown | Medium | Private key repo — need to verify it exists locally | 🟡 Open |

## What "Success" Looks Like Tomorrow

When opening the repository tomorrow morning:

- `02_MEMORY/experience/` has new entries (not just from manual runs)
- New questions were autonomously generated
- New tasks were autonomously created
- Even if tasks were rejected by Governor — that's still success
- The system produced work without user input

> If one day you open the computer and see:
> "Last night I discovered three problems worth researching. One is verified,
> two I suggest continuing today."
> — that's when R2 has truly inherited R1.

---

## Next Action

1. Let the system run overnight — observe if it autonomously produces work
2. Tomorrow: Integrate Awareness Loop into Heartbeat (TASK-006)
3. Tomorrow: Widen investigation rules (TASK-007)
4. Tomorrow: TASK-003 Provider Health persistence
